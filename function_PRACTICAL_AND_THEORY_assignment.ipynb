        "# What is the difference between a function and a method in Python\n",
        " In Python, both **functions** and **methods** are callable objects, but they have key differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Function**:\n",
        "- A **function** is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called independently.\n",
        "- It is defined using the `def` keyword, and it doesn't belong to any specific object or class.\n",
        "- Functions can be defined globally (outside of any class) and can take any number of arguments.\n",
        "  \n",
        "#### Example of a function:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def greet(name):\n",
        "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "You call it directly by its name:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "print(greet(\"Alice\"))\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Method**:\n",
        "- A **method** is a function that is associated with an object, usually an instance of a class.\n",
        "- It is defined within a class and is meant to operate on the instance (object) or the class itself.\n",
        "- Methods take at least one argument: `self` (for instance methods) or `cls` (for class methods), which refers to the instance or class.\n",
        "  \n",
        "#### Example of a method:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "    \n",
        "    def greet(self):\n",
        "        return f\"Hello, {self.name}!\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "You call a method on an object (instance) of the class:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "person = Person(\"Bob\")\n",
        "print(person.greet())\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Differences:\n",
        "- **Scope**: A function is defined globally, while a method is tied to a class or an object.\n",
        "- **Calling**: You call a function by its name, whereas you call a method using an object or class.\n",
        "- **Parameters**: A method takes `self` (for instance methods) or `cls` (for class methods) as its first parameter, while a function does not.\n",
        "  \n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "- **Function**: Independent, defined outside a class, called by its name.\n",
        "- **Method**: Defined within a class, called on an object of the class."

        "\n",
        "### 1. **Parameters**:\n",
        "- **Parameters** are the variables defined in a function's definition. They act as placeholders that specify what kind of information the function expects to receive when it's called.\n",

        "  \n",
        "#### Example of a parameter:\n",

        "def greet(name):  # 'name' is the parameter\n",
        "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "In this example, `name` is a **parameter** of the function `greet`. It will hold the value passed when the function is called.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Arguments**:\n",
        "- **Arguments** are the actual values or data you pass to a function when you call it.\n",
        "- Arguments are supplied in the function call and are assigned to the corresponding parameters in the function's definition.\n",
        "  \n",

        "# What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        " The `return` statement in Python serves a crucial purpose: it allows a function to **send back** a result to the caller and **exit** the function. When the `return` statement is executed, the function stops running, and the specified value (or values) are returned to the place where the function was called.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Purposes of the `return` Statement:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Returning a Value**:\n",
        "   - The primary purpose of the `return` statement is to **send a result** back to the caller. This allows the caller to use the returned value in further operations.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   #### Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def add(a, b):\n",
        "       return a + b  # Returning the sum of a and b\n",
        "\n",
        "   result = add(3, 4)  # Calling the function and storing the result\n",
        "   print(result)  # Output will be 7\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   In this example, the `add` function calculates the sum of `a` and `b` and returns it. The result is then stored in the `result` variable and printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Exiting the Function**:\n",
        "   - The `return` statement also causes the function to **exit** immediately. Any code after the `return` statement within the function will not be executed.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   #### Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def process_number(number):\n",
        "       if number < 0:\n",
        "           return \"Negative number\"\n",
        "       return number * 2\n",
        "\n",
        "   print(process_number(-5))  # Output will be \"Negative number\"\n",
        "   print(process_number(4))   # Output will be 8\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   In this case, when the input number is negative, the function immediately returns the string `\"Negative number\"`, and it doesn't continue to multiply the number by 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Returning Multiple Values**:\n",
        "   - A function can return multiple values using a tuple, list, or any other collection. These values can be accessed individually if needed.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   #### Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def calculate(a, b):\n",
        "       sum_result = a + b\n",
        "       difference = a - b\n",
        "       return sum_result, difference  # Returning two values as a tuple\n",
        "\n",
        "   result_sum, result_diff = calculate(10, 5)\n",
        "   print(result_sum)  # Output will be 15\n",
        "   print(result_diff)  # Output will be 5\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   Here, the function returns two values (the sum and the difference), which are unpacked into the variables `result_sum` and `result_diff`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Returning `None` by Default**:\n",
        "   - If no `return` statement is specified in a function, the function **implicitly returns** `None` when it completes execution. This is useful when a function performs actions (like printing or modifying objects) but does not need to return a value.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   #### Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def greet(name):\n",
        "       print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   result = greet(\"Alice\")  # No return value, so 'result' will be None\n",
        "   print(result)  # Output will be None\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Using `return` in Recursion**:\n",
        "   - In recursive functions, the `return` statement helps in returning the result of recursive calls back through the recursive stack.\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def factorial(n):\n",
        "       if n == 0:\n",
        "           return 1\n",
        "       return n * factorial(n - 1)  # Recursively calling factorial and returning the result\n",
        "\n",
        "   print(factorial(5))  # Output will be 120\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   Here, the `return` statement is used to return the computed factorial back through the recursive calls.\n",
        " # . What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        " In Python, the terms **iterator** and **iterable** are related but refer to different concepts. Let's break down what each of these means and how they differ:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Iterable**:\n",
        "An **iterable** is any object in Python that can be **iterated over**, meaning it can be used in a loop (such as a `for` loop). An object is considered iterable if it implements the **`__iter__()`** method or if it implements the **`__getitem__()`** method.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Iterable** objects include data structures like:\n",
        "  - Lists\n",
        "  - Tuples\n",
        "  - Strings\n",
        "  - Dictionaries (iterate over keys, values, or items)\n",
        "  - Sets\n",
        "  - Files (can be iterated line by line)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example of an Iterable:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# A list is an iterable\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "\n",
        "# We can use an iterable in a loop\n",
        "for item in my_list:\n",
        "    print(item)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The key point here is that **iterables** are containers or objects that **can provide an iterator** when requested.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Iterator**:\n",
        "An **iterator** is an object that represents a stream of data. It is the object that actually performs the **iteration**. Iterators have two key characteristics:\n",
        "- They implement the **`__next__()`** method (which returns the next value in the sequence).\n",

        "### **Generators in Python:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A **generator** in Python is a special type of iterator that is defined using a function. Instead of returning a single value like a normal function, a generator function can yield multiple values, one at a time, and pause its execution between each yield. The key advantage of generators is that they allow you to create large sequences of data without consuming a lot of memory, making them more efficient than using lists for large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Concepts of Generators:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Lazy Evaluation**:\n",
        "   - Generators use **lazy evaluation**, meaning they generate values only when they are needed (on-demand). This allows you to handle large datasets without storing all the values in memory at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`yield` Keyword**:\n",
        "   - The **`yield`** keyword is used to produce a value from a generator function. When a generator function encounters a `yield`, it produces the value and **pauses** its execution, saving its state. When `next()` is called again on the generator, it resumes from where it left off, continuing the iteration until it either exhausts the values or reaches the end of the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **State Retention**:\n",
        "   - A generator maintains its internal state across calls, meaning it remembers where it was in the function when the `yield` statement was last executed. This makes generators more memory-efficient because they donâ€™t need to store all the values at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How Generators are Defined:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators are defined in two ways:\n",
        "1. **Generator Function** (Using `yield`)\n",
        "2. **Generator Expressions** (Using similar syntax to list comprehensions)\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Generator Function:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A generator function looks like a regular function but contains one or more `yield` statements. When called, it does not execute immediately but returns a generator object that can be iterated over.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example of a Generator Function:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def count_up_to(limit):\n",
        "    count = 1\n",
        "    while count <= limit:\n",
        "        yield count  # Yield the current count, then pause execution\n",
        "        count += 1\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Calling the Generator:\n",
        "When you call a generator function, it returns a generator object, which can be iterated using a `for` loop or `next()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "counter = count_up_to(5)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Iterate through the generator using a for loop\n",
        "for num in counter:\n",
        "    print(num)  # Output will be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Alternatively, you can manually get values from the generator using `next()`:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "counter = count_up_to(3)\n",
        "print(next(counter))  # Output will be 1\n",
        "print(next(counter))  # Output will be 2\n",
        "print(next(counter))  # Output will be 3\n",
        "print(next(counter))  # Raises StopIteration as the generator is exhausted\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Points about Generator Functions:\n",
        "- **`yield`** produces a value and pauses the functionâ€™s state.\n",
        "- The function resumes execution when the next value is requested.\n",
        "- It allows the function to return multiple values one at a time, instead of returning all the values at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Generator Expressions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A generator expression is similar to a list comprehension but uses parentheses instead of square brackets. It is more concise and often used for short generator creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example of a Generator Expression:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "squares = (x * x for x in range(5))  # A generator expression\n",
        "\n",
        "# Iterate through the generator expression\n",
        "for square in squares:\n",
        "    print(square)  # Output will be: 0, 1, 4, 9, 16\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The generator expression here is used to create a generator that will yield the square of each number in the range from 0 to 4.\n",
        " # . What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "Using **generators** in Python offers several advantages over regular functions, especially when dealing with large datasets or when you need to implement efficient, memory-friendly iteration. Here are the key advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Memory Efficiency**:\n",
        "   - **Generators use lazy evaluation**, meaning they generate values **on-demand** and do not store the entire dataset in memory at once. This is particularly useful when working with large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
        "   - **Regular functions** that return large collections (like lists) store all the data in memory at once, which can be inefficient and cause memory issues when dealing with large amounts of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### Example:\n",
        "   - If you want to generate the first 1 million square numbers:\n",
        "     - **List**:\n",
        "       ```python\n",
        "       squares = [x * x for x in range(1, 1000001)]  # Takes up a lot of memory\n",
        "       ```\n",
        "     - **Generator**:\n",
        "       ```python\n",
        "       squares = (x * x for x in range(1, 1000001))  # Much more memory-efficient\n",
        "       ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   The generator produces each value one by one, whereas the list comprehension creates and stores all 1 million values in memory at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Performance Improvement (Speed)**:\n",
        "   - **Generators** allow you to process data one item at a time, rather than creating and holding large data structures in memory. This can be a significant performance improvement in cases where you need to process a large amount of data but don't need to hold all the results at once.\n",
        "   - For **regular functions**, if you're returning a collection like a list, the function must first process all elements and store them in memory before returning.\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### Example:\n",
        "   - If youâ€™re working with an input stream, a generator will process each item as it comes, reducing the time required to handle large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Infinite Sequences**:\n",
        "   - Generators can represent **infinite sequences** or very large datasets that you can't store entirely in memory. This is not possible with regular functions that return finite collections like lists or tuples.\n",
        "   - Since generators produce values one at a time and donâ€™t need to store the entire sequence, they can generate infinite sequences (e.g., Fibonacci series, prime numbers) without running out of memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### Example of an Infinite Generator:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def infinite_count():\n",
        "       n = 1\n",
        "       while True:\n",
        "           yield n\n",
        "           n += 1\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   This generator can produce an infinite sequence of numbers. You can stop it anytime or iterate over it for as long as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Cleaner and More Readable Code**:\n",
        "   - Generators can simplify **complex iteration logic**. Instead of manually managing iteration states with indices or maintaining counters, you can directly yield values, making the code **more concise and readable**.\n",
        "   - Using **`yield`** avoids the need for temporary variables or additional bookkeeping to manage the state of the iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### Example (Without Generators):\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def get_even_numbers(n):\n",
        "       even_numbers = []\n",
        "       for i in range(n):\n",
        "           if i % 2 == 0:\n",
        "               even_numbers.append(i)\n",
        "       return even_numbers\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   - This function generates all even numbers up to `n` and stores them in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### Example (Using Generators):\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def get_even_numbers(n):\n",
        "       for i in range(n):\n",
        "           if i % 2 == 0:\n",
        "               yield i  # Yield each even number one at a time\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   The generator version is much cleaner, and it produces values one at a time without needing to store them all at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Simplified Control of Flow**:\n",
        "   - With **`yield`**, you can pause a function's execution, return a value, and resume from where the function left off when the next value is requested. This control flow is **natural** and **intuitive** for certain types of problems, such as implementing coroutines or managing state in long-running operations.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - Regular functions that use return values typically execute from start to finish without the ability to pause and resume easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### Example of Generator's Control Flow:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def fibonacci(n):\n",
        "       a, b = 0, 1\n",
        "       for _ in range(n):\n",
        "           yield a\n",
        "           a, b = b, a + b  # Update values for the next iteration\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   In this example, the generator can produce each Fibonacci number one at a time, pausing after each `yield` and resuming on the next call.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Reduced Overhead**:\n",
        "   - Regular functions that return lists or other collections require the entire dataset to be built and stored in memory before itâ€™s returned. In contrast, **generators yield one item at a time**, allowing you to avoid unnecessary overhead, especially in cases where you only need a portion of the data or when data is being processed in a streaming fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - This can result in reduced CPU and memory overhead, as you aren't allocating large structures to hold intermediate results.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **Asynchronous Programming (with `async` Generators)**:\n",
        "   - Generators, combined with **`async`** (in Python 3.6 and later), enable **asynchronous iteration**. This allows you to work with asynchronous data sources like network responses, databases, or file reads, yielding results without blocking the main execution thread.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - This is especially useful in scenarios where you are interacting with multiple external systems that may have varying response times.\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### Example of an Async Generator:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   import asyncio\n",
        "\n",
        "   async def async_count():\n",
        "       count = 1\n",
        "       while True:\n",
        "           await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate waiting for an external source\n",
        "           yield count\n",
        "           count += 1\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   This generator can be used in an asynchronous event loop to process items as they arrive, without blocking the program.\n",
        "   # What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "   A **lambda function** in Python is a small, anonymous (unnamed) function defined using the **`lambda`** keyword.

These functions are often used for simple operations and are frequently employed in cases where a full function definition would be unnecessary or overkill.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Syntax of a Lambda Function:**\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **In Functional Programming Contexts**:\n",

        "  The **`map()`** function in Python is a built-in function used to apply a given function to all items in an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) and return an iterator (or map object) that yields the results of the function applied to each item in the iterable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Syntax of the `map()` Function**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "map(function, iterable, ...)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`function`**: This is the function to which the items in the iterable(s) will be passed.\n",
        "- **`iterable`**: The iterable (such as a list, tuple, etc.) whose items will be processed by the function. You can pass more than one iterable if the function requires multiple arguments, and the items will be taken from the iterables in parallel.\n",
        "- The **`map()`** function returns a **map object**, which is an iterator. To obtain the results, you generally convert it into a list or another iterable using `list()`, `tuple()`, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How `map()` Works**:\n",
        "The `map()` function applies the specified function to each item of the iterable and returns an iterator that can be used to retrieve the processed items. The iteration stops when the shortest iterable is exhausted if multiple iterables are provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example of Using `map()` with a Single Iterable**:\n",
        "Suppose you want to square all the elements of a list. Using `map()`, you can apply the `lambda` function to each item of the list.\n",
        "\n",

        "- `lambda x: x ** 2` is the function that will be applied to each item of the `numbers` list.\n",
        "- `map()` applies this function to each element of `numbers` and returns an iterator. The `list()` function is used to convert the map object into a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example of Using `map()` with Multiple Iterables**:\n",
        "You can pass multiple iterables to the `map()` function. The function passed to `map()` should then accept as many arguments as there are iterables.\n",
